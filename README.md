# FICTURE

FICTURE: Scalable segmentation-free analysis of sub-micron resolution spatial transcriptomics

[preprint](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.11.04.565621v2)


*This repository is under active construction*

Currently there are two main branches, the _stable_ branch is a version of FICTURE used in our internal pipeline; the _pypi_ branch is a version that is lagging behind the _stable_ branch but has all core functionalities and is available from pypi. In the near future we will merge these two branches and choose a consistent interface.

## Example

See `./examples/realdata.md` for commands of processing an example data in `./examples/data/`. The data is a subset from a public Vizgen MERSCOPE mouse liver dataset (mouse liver 1 slice 1). The scripts are meant for much larger data.
